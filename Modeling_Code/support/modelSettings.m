% modelSettings
%
% This function initializes and returns the folder paths, plot settings, and run settings used in the steering model simulations.
% It sets up essential parameters required for running the fly steering simulations, including simulation parameters,
% neuron-related settings, and paths for saving output data and plots.
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   folder        - A struct containing paths to directories for saving various types of data.
%   plotSettings  - A struct containing settings for plotting the model outputs.
%   runSettings   - A struct containing model-specific parameters for the simulation.
%
% DESCRIPTION:
% The `modelSettings` function initializes key parameters and settings that are used across different simulation runs and visualizations.
% It defines parameters for the visual object position, neuron delays, low-pass filter settings for noise, and the receptive field colors.
% Additionally, the function defines folder paths where simulation outputs and visualizations will be saved, and configures general plotting properties.
%
% Example usage:
%   [folder, plotSettings, runSettings] = modelSettings();

function [folder, plotSettings, runSettings] = modelSettings()
