% FIXATIONFINDER - This function identifies periods of fixation and running behavior in flies
% based on panel position (yaw) and forward velocity data. Fixation is determined by the moving
% mean of unwrapped panel position, with thresholds applied to ensure that fixations meet duration
% and gap criteria. The function also identifies periods where the fly is both fixating and running.

% INPUTS:
%   panelps    - 3D array of panel position data, where each slice represents a condition, 
%                and each column represents a trial.
%   forward    - 3D array of forward velocity data corresponding to each trial.
%   expttime   - Time vector corresponding to the temporal resolution of the data.
%   optPlot    - Optional flag (1/0) to plot the results for a sanity check (1 for yes, 0 for no).

% OUTPUT:
%   fixation   - Structure containing fixation indices and filtered panel/forward data:
%                - fixation.panelps_all : Panel position data where the fly was fixating.
%                - fixation.forward_all : Forward velocity data where the fly was fixating.
%                - fixation.idx_all     : Logical indices indicating fixation periods.
%                - fixation.panelps_run : Panel position data where the fly was both fixating and running.
%                - fixation.forward_run : Forward velocity data where the fly was both fixating and running.
%                - fixation.idx_run     : Logical indices indicating fixation and running periods.

% The function:
% - Unwraps the panel position to avoid discontinuities and computes a moving mean.
% - Applies thresholds for fixation based on the range of the moving mean.
% - Identifies fixation periods that meet minimum duration criteria and merges adjacent
%   fixations if the gap between them is below the maximum allowed gap.
% - Detects running behavior based on forward velocity and combines it with fixation indices
%   to find periods where the fly is both fixating and running.
% - Optionally plots the panel position and fixation periods for visualization.
